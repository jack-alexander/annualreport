# Events South Australia

### Events South Australia is the major events arm of the South Australian Government and a division of the SATC. It exists to attract visitors to the State and promote South Australia as a tourism destination through securing, managing, developing and supporting leisure events and festivals and providing leadership to the events and festivals industry.

The priority actions for Events South Australia, in line with the Tourism 2020 Priority Action Areas, and particularly the action area of Using Events to Grow Visitation are:

* Manage, secure and sponsor events, in conjunction with partners, to build a balanced calendar of events.
* Focus sponsorship on core strength areas such as arts and culture, food and wine, sport and mass participation, with a particular focus on off-peak periods and utilizing key infrastructure.
* Develop the capacity building program for major, regional and local/community events and festivals across the state.
* Increase awareness and consideration of SA hero events through collaborative marketing and partnerships to trigger visitation.
In addition to this, Events South Australia works to contribute to the Government’s economic priorities, particularly Premium Food and Wine Produced in Our Clean Environment and Exported to the World and Adelaide, the Heart of a Vibrant City. Events South Australia manages four events: The Santos Tour Down Under, the Credit Union Christmas Pageant, Tasting Australia (currently a biennial event that will become annual from 2016) and the Adelaide Fashion Festival (an announcement was made in February 2015 that Events South Australia would manage the event from 2015 onwards).
In 2014-15 two of these events were held – the Credit Union Christmas Pageant and Santos Tour Down Under. Furthermore, Events South Australia supported 39 events ranging from large scale events such as WOMADelaide and AFL Masters to smaller events across South Australia as part of the Regional Events and Festivals Program. Events South Australia comprises two business units:

### Event Management

This unit manages events owned by the SATC as well as providing support to sponsored events and the industry.

#### Credit Union Christmas Pageant

##### 8 November 2014

The Credit Union Christmas Pageant, in its 82nd year is a truly South Australian community event. In 2014, 170 moving theatrical sets kept the 345,000 people lining the streets entertained through colour, movement, dancing, singing and wonderful designs as they welcomed Father Christmas and heralded the start of the Christmas season. Partnerships are integral to the success of the Credit Union Christmas Pageant and the most significant of these is that of the naming right sponsor of 19 years, the Credit Union Pageant Company which includes the People’s Choice Credit Union, Beyond Bank, Credit Union SA and Police Credit Union.

The 2014 Credit Union Christmas Pageant was broadcast on the Nine Network. It secured the number one ratings position in Adelaide on pageant day, peaking at 146,221 viewers and totalling 215,000 for the live broadcast and replay. For the first time in 2014, the TV broadcast program was streamed on the internet via the Nine Network’s 9jumpin, enabling viewers from around Australia the ability to watch the event online at any time.

Five months of media activity was created in the lead-up to the 2014 event, with a total audience reach of approximately 35.1 million providing a total PR value of $18.2 million. This figure has more than tripled the PR value in 2011, illustrating the increasing interest and fascination with this world-class event.

A new Credit Union Christmas Pageant event website was created in 2014 delivering 12% growth. . The Pageant Facebook community reached 14,098 and has had significant growth in the last four years growing from 457 fans in 2010.

#### Santos Tour Down Under

##### 17-25 January, 2015

The Santos Tour Down Under is the first cycling race on the UCI WorldTour calendar. The 2015 event marked the 18th edition of the Santos Tour Down Under, and one of the most successful tours to date. The overall attendance at the event was 786,022, up from 762,666 in 2014. The event attracted 37,370 interstate and overseas visitors, an increase of 26,807 from the 2014 event. This equated to an economic impact of $47.9 million which was also an increase on the 2014 event where the economic impact was $45.9 million.

In addition to the increase in visitation and dollars into the South Australian economy, we also had great growth in the promotional value of the event. The editorial media coverage for the Santos Tour Down Under increased PR value of $167 million in 2014 to $194 million and the national and international television broadcast hours increased by 50 percent to 527 hours programming highlighting South Australia’s tourism assets to viewers in key national and international markets. This included a live 2.5 hour program daily on Nine Network’s GEM (with Stage 1 on Channel Nine) and one hour of highlights on Channel Nine each night. Australia’s only Tour de France winner, Cadel Evans, proved a great drawcard as he competed in his very last UCI WorldTour race at the 2015 Santos Tour Down Under. South Australia and our visitors gave him a wonderful send-off.

South Australian rider Rohan Dennis, from team BMC, won the overall event. This was the first time a South Australian has won the Santos Tour Down Under since Patrick Jonker in 2004.

Three time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond was honoured at the Legend’s Night Dinner, the gala dinner of the Santos Tour Down Under, a place to celebrate and mingle with the legends of world cycling.

The inaugural Santos Women’s Tour took place in conjunction with the 2015 Santos Tour Down Under and formed part of Cycling Australia’s

Subaru National Road Series. 95 entrants competed, including riders from 11 countries, making it one of the strongest women’s races ever held in Australia.

Italy’s Valentina Scandalora, riding for Australian team ORICA-AIS, was crowned the winner in front of more than 4,000 supporters at Victoria Park.

A number of new events and activities were added to the event in addition to the existing street parties and Adelaide City Tour Village and Bike Expo. These included the Subaru Tour Tracker, a mobile and tablet app which allowed users to track the race and view the live broadcast. This proved extremely popular with almost 21,000 downloads.

Family Day was introduced to Stage 6 with activities on offer such as a mini BMX track and healthy make-your-own breakfasts to complement the existing Bupa Mini Tour for Kids. The Ladies Day on Tour hosted by Liza Emanuele, a leading Adelaide fashion designer and the designer of the Santos Tour Down Under tour host outfits, was held during Stage 3. Guests were able to experience a race start and lunch along the race route at Stirling. Ladies Day on Tour sold out within two days of going on sale.

In addition to this, the Santos Tour Down Under announced cycling legends German Jens Voigt (a recently retired professional cycling with a huge public following) and Australian Anna Meares (an Olympic, World Champion and Commonwealth Gold Medallist in track cycling) would be ambassadors for the event. Their roles include pre-promotion of the 2016 Santos Tour Down Under and its activities, as well as attendance at key functions throughout the year and at the event.

#### Tasting Australia

Tasting Australia is South Australia’s premier food and wine festival and one of the pre-eminent food and wine festivals in Australia. The event is currently held biennially, with the most recent event being held from 27 April to 4 May 2014. From 2016, Tasting Australia will become an annual event with the 2016 event to be held from 1-8 May. An annual event will better promote the Premier’s economic priority of premium food and wine produced in our clean environment and exported to the world. Annualisation will also provide better opportunities to secure sponsorship and create momentum with consumers and media.

Strategic and program planning as well as producing a brand framework for the event have been the priorities in 2014-15. The aim of Tasting Australia is to be ‘the must attend’ culinary festival in Australia and the creative campaign will focus on the idea that you will heighten your eating and drinking experience at Tasting Australia.

Key programming elements from the 2014 event will be included in 2016, along with a series of new program offerings and consumer experiences. Town Square will return as the Tasting Australia hub and will be open for the eight days of the festival. Conferencing and industry focussed events will be added to the Town Square program to ensure consistent visitation over the eight days.

#### Adelaide Fashion Festival

In February 2015, the State Government announced that the South Australian Tourism Commission would take ownership of the Adelaide Fashion Festival which was established in 2008 by the City of Norwood, Payneham and St Peters Council. Since its inception the focus of the event has been on profiling upcoming South Australian designers, promoting the council district and driving a retail spike.

The Adelaide Fashion Festival will be held from 22-25 October which is a shorter event than previously held, with the impetus on having a compact, high impact international standard event. The key goals for the event include promoting South Australia to a target audience which includes Asia, particularly Shandong in China; driving further growth in South Australia’s local fashion and creative industries, from retail to design (and associated industries); adding another significant event to South Australia’s event calendar which contributes to the State brand and is consistent with the vibrant city agenda.

#### BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

The Business Development unit of Events South Australia has a focus on maximising the tourism, economic and social outcomes of events through securing, developing and sponsoring leisure events and festivals. The State Government has committed to an Events Bid Fund totalling \$6 million over four years, starting in 2014-15. The Events Bid Fund allows South Australia to strategically attract events which complement the State’s ongoing annual events and deliver significant tourism and economic outcomes for the State. To date ten events have been secured through the Events Bid Fund including the Liverpool Football Club v Adelaide United Match, Rescue 2018 World Lifesaving Championships and the 2016 Australian Swimming Championships (which will be the selection trials for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio). These ten events are forecast to inject $51.4 million into the State’s economy.

#### Sponsored Events

Events South Australia provides support for growth to a range of events through sponsorship, public relations and activities.

In 2014-15, Events South Australia supported 12 major events: South Australian Living Artists (SALA) Festival, AFL Masters National Carnival, The Suit, Australian Duathlon Championships, 2014 Australian Short Course Swimming Championships, Australian International 3 Day Event, Feast Festival, Australian All School Championships, World Tennis Challenge, ICC Cricket World Cup, Australian Baseball League Championship Series and WOMADelaide.

Examples of sponsored events success include:

* AFL Masters  
The AFL Masters national carnival is an opportunity for footballers over 35 years of age to represent their State in its 34^th^ year, the National Carnival was held in Adelaide and played at the Westminster School in Marion in October 2014. Forty teams attended the 2014 event, with 819 players, well above the average of 600-700 players the competition usually receives. 84 per cent of attendees were visitors to the State. It is estimated that the total expenditure by carnival participants, supporters and families was just over $3.7m.

* ICC Cricket World Cup  
Events South Australia managed South Australia’s involvement in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, coordinating the various working committees to deliver and maximise the impact of this significant event. South Australia hosted six 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup matches, including a pool match involving India vs Pakistan which was a sell out with more than 45 per cent attendees travelling from interstate and 10 per cent from overseas. The match was viewed by a vast international audience, not only in India and Pakistan, but also in the United Kingdom, USA and around the world. The Economic Impacts and Benefits Analysis Report of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup showed that the matches played in Adelaide generated about \$80 million to the State’s economy, attracted 73,289 visitors and accumulated 255,000 bed nights. Of these visitors, nearly 34,000 were international tourists staying an average of 3.9 bed nights and generating approximately \$50 million in expenditure. Leveraging of this event opportunity was maximised by a partnership with the Department of State Development and Austrade to host the India- South Australia Business Forum where business representatives explored trade and investment opportunities across a three day program of activities. In addition to this, the Dream Team 15 Program was established which offered the opportunity of a lifetime to 15 young males from across India to visit Adelaide in February 2015 for extensive cricket training, coaching and competition against local schools, plus the chance to promote and attend the ICC Cricket World Cup match between India and Pakistan.

* WOMADelaide  
Held from 6 to 9 March 2015, the 23^rd^ WOMADelaide was held in Botanic Park and included headline artists Sinead O’Connor (Ireland) and Abdullah Ibrahim (South Africa). This world music festival attracted attendances of more than 90,000 and contributed $11.8 million to the State’s economy. For the first time, the event introduced The Street ADL in The Park – Taste the World Restaurant with founder and creator Jock Zonfrillo (Orana Restaurant) preparing the best of the world’s street food and inspired recipes within a festive sit down atmosphere.

* Regional Events and Festival
In 2014-15 Events South Australia supported 26 regional events.

A feasibility study for the Clare Valley Cruise was also supported.

#### Industry Development

In 2014-15 Events South Australia managed a successful Events and Festivals Industry Workshop held on 19 November 2014 in American River, Kangaroo Island. Thirty people registered to attend. The day was a success with participants learning how to develop an event concept, and the processes to consider before implementing the event plans. Funding for events was also a topic that many showed interest in.
The Events South Australia also enjoyed working closely with a range of other
events to help them grow and develop throughout the year. In 2014-15 Events
South Australia began communicating current issues and trends through its
newsletter Events South Australia News.
