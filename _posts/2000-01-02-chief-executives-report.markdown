# Chief Executive Report

### I am very pleased to provide this year’s annual report, which details the SATC’s recent endeavors in helping to grow the State’s visitor economy. Tourism is an economic development strategy, a critical pillar for South Australia, and the Government has recognized this potential and recently elevated its status as one of its ten economic priorities.

Tourism is spread deeply across the South Australian economy, covering all regions and consuming goods and services across cafes, restaurants, retail establishments, accommodation providers, transport services, bars, tour companies, the arts and events.

We as a Commission recognise our role in building a resilient tourism industry, one which supports 18,000 businesses and directly employs 32,000 South Australians, many of who are young people enjoying their first job and pursuing their career aspirations. Currently contributing \$5.4-billion to our economy annually, we are steadfast in achieving the full potential of $8-billion in tourism expenditure by 2020 – which would also generate a further 10,000 jobs in South Australia.

This year the Commission endeavored to realise this expenditure target by concentrating on the State’s competitive strengths – food and wine, festivals and events, accessible nature and a vibrant Adelaide as the arrow head toward 11 accessible, and unique, regional experiences.

These were the attributes being promoted to South Australians, and effectively projected to domestic and international audiences from our traditional markets in the United Kingdom, Americas, Germany and New Zealand and emerging Asian markets of China and India.

Notably, 60 campaigns in international markets aimed at increasing awareness, and driving demand for South Australia as a holiday destination, helped to welcome a record number of international visitors, while our State prospered through an increase in international expenditure to $735-million.

The Commission continued to engage with cruise lines to promote Adelaide and South Australia as a premium cruise destination in Australia. More cruise ships enjoyed our ports this year with passengers and crew dispersing into our city and regions.

We can’t escape the impact that these challenging times have for our airline partners. While increased competition, compounded by other economic challenges and global aviation tragedies affected flight numbers, our State witnessed over 10,000 international seats – already above the Tourism Plan 2020 target, and serving our airport in its recent status as the fastest growing international airport in Australia.

Building on the strength of South Australia’s reputation of world-renowned food and wine is crucial to the growth of the tourism industry as a whole. That is why the Commission continued to implement the ‘Barossa ‘Be Consumed’ campaign and created a series of touring routes – a succinct way to highlight the best of our regions.

Yet, our city needed to be more visible – highlighted by the lure of vibrant, welcoming Adelaide, the ‘Greater Adelaide’ campaign continued to be presented to national audiences. These campaigns also played a part in reminding South Australian’s of what is on their door step, and what is truly special about their State. It also shaped, and ignited, a renewed image, driving growth in domestic airline weekly seats, overnight visits and importantly expenditure.

Events, both leisure and business, are mainstays of the State’s Tourism Strategy. Positively, they continued to drive visitation, expenditure and hotel occupancy, while also helping to create a vibrancy and a sense of pride in our State.

The Adelaide Convention Centre Bid Fund has already helped to secure 12 major conventions, welcoming more than 14,000 delegates to Adelaide and generating over $55-million in economic benefit. But the net worth of these events far exceeded their commercial returns. They validated South Australia’s business capabilities, facilitated stronger international links and showcased major redevelopments to the iconic Adelaide Oval, the Adelaide Casino and the creation of one of the world’s largest and most significant health and medical clusters, the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI).

Major leisure events not only display our State as a unique destination, they attract visitors, spectators and event participants as well as create jobs, increase spend and lengthen the time visitors stay.

This year, ten events were secured through the Events Bidding Fund, injecting over $51-million into the State’s economy. These funds allowed us to present football royalty, in the Liverpool Football Club, and in future play host to other events, such as, the Australian Swimming Championships and the World Lifesaving Championships.

Events undoubtedly showcase our people and places on a global stage. We again opened our door to the heart of our city and regions, greeting world class athletes to the Santos Tour Down Under –contributing nearly $48-million to our economy.

This year we proved our capabilities further in the international event arena. The ICC Cricket World Cup captured the attention of international audiences with the inspirational Adelaide Oval hosting one of the world’s most viewed sporting events.

In closing, I would like to welcome the appointment of the new Chair of the SATC, Mr Sean Keenihan. I look forward to his leadership in continuing to pursue the implementation of the Tourism Plan 2020, and expertise on pivotal areas critical to realising our ambitions.

Likewise, I would like to acknowledge Jane Jeffreys for her exemplary leadership as Chair of the SATC over a numbers of years. Her vision and governance is validated by the respect the Commission has earned across both Government and industry.

The SATC looks forward to continuing to grow the visitor economy through working with industry, our regions, our partners in Study Adelaide, Primary Industries and Regions SA, the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources, and importantly, the broader community to achieve much more for our State.

Collectively, we are committed, and continue to be motivated, in delivering real economic benefits – promoting confidence and pride amongst South Australians, helping to deliver on the principle of a vibrant city and establishing our State as the destination of choice for international and domestic travelers.
