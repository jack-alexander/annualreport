# Marketing & Communications

### SATC marketing activity is designed to increase awareness and consideration for South Australia whilst building positive perceptions about SA as a tourism destination brand. This in turn will convert consumer consideration to actual visitation, thus contributing to the 2020 expenditure goal.

Marketing and Communications works across the SATC in the delivery of initiatives such as digital and visual content, partnership campaign activity, promotion of events, experiences and product. The group currently consists of three key areas: Marketing Communications, Digital Marketing and Regional Marketing.

The Marketing Communications team is responsible for the development and delivery of SATC interstate and intrastate marketing activity, including consumer and events management, partnerships marketing, brand and content management and marketing insights.

The Regional Marketing team is responsible for supporting regions, the production of visitor guides, visual assets and supporting the South Australian Visitor Information Centre network.\ The Digital team manages digital and online marketing development and maintenance, including content management of all tourism and event websites, Search Engine Marketing activity and social media management.

### Digitial Marketing

#### Digital Development

The Digital Development team is responsible for the project management and implementation of the digital ‘evolution’ of SATC’s online channels. This includes ensuring they are in-line with consumer needs and industry best practice.

#### Online Management

The Online unit is responsible for the management of SATC’s online and mobile assets, including southaustralia.com, m.southaustralia.com, events. southaustralia.com, trade.southaustralia.com, tourdownunder.com.au, m.tourdownunder.com.au, cupageant.com.au, tasting-australia.com.au, tourism.sa.gov.au, Australian Tourism Data Warehouse (ATDW) and social media, as well as providing online marketing services and advice to other SATC units and to the tourism industry. The key focus for the team is delivering user friendly relevant content using core capabilities in social media, analytics, search engine optimisation and web copywriting techniques.

### Marketing Communications

#### Consumer Marketing

The SATC Consumer Marketing unit, in conjunction with creative agency partner KWP!, implements integrated campaigns through a variety of media booked through master media agency MEC (including television, cinema, print, magazine, digital/online and outdoor) to best reach our relevant target markets both interstate and intrastate. The team works closely with the Online and Destination Public Relations teams to amplify campaign messages across our social media platforms and through publicity.

#### Events Marketing

Events Marketing is responsible for the marketing, advertising and promotion of all SATC’s owned and managed events; Santos Tour Down Under, Tasting Australia and the Credit Union Christmas Pageant. This unit also supports SATC sponsored events and provides marketing advice and assistance to regional markets with their event plans.

Advertising agencies Jam, WDM, and George Patterson Y&R were the creative agency partners for the 2014/2015 owned events marketing campaigns.

Master media agency MEC is also pertinent to media requirements for particular campaigns. The objective of the Events Marketing team is to ensure that all event marketing fulfils not only the strategic objectives set for Events South Australia, but also the overall objectives of the State’s Strategic Plan.

#### Partnership Marketing

Partnership Marketing is responsible for SATC’s partnerships with domestic airlines, wholesalers, retail travel agents, online travel agents and other tourism partners. The aim of the partnership team is to increase the amount of SA product contracted and sold by these partners, leverage and grow investment with partners, undertake cooperative marketing campaign activities and educate reservation staff on South Australia’s key experiences; enabling them to be better sellers of South Australia.

The team plays a vital role in linking South Australian tourism operators to our industry partners, and identifying opportunities for tactical promotions, as well as identifying opportunities for packaging of South Australian events including the Santos Tour Down Under.



#### Marketing Insights

Research is an integral part of marketing strategy development, and the tracking and monitoring of SATC marketing activity. Insights are gathered from various sources, including BDA tracker reporting, and where necessary, commissioned research.

The Insights unit works closely with SATC’s Strategy team to ensure alignment and to leverage available data (NVS, TOMM, BDA). Interstate and intrastate marketing campaigns are tracked on a monthly basis via a BDA communications tracker, allowing for ongoing optimisation of marketing activity. Management of SATC-supported sponsorships for key South Australian events (including Cabaret Festival, Adelaide Festival, Adelaide Fringe etc.) is also the responsibility of the Marketing Insights area. This ensures these events are effectively leveraged to build the South Australian tourism brand and grow awareness, particularly for the interstate market. The Marketing Insights unit is also responsible for managing SATC-supported programs SA Life, South Aussie with Cosi and PLONK to ensure optimal return on investment, and strategic alignment from these sponsorships.

#### Brand Management

The brand team is responsible for managing the output of all SATC marketing collateral and materials including print, photography and video, as well as providing advice and approvals across all advertising campaigns on an intrastate and interstate level. Working with a panel of nine external creative service agencies, these companies provide design and artwork creation for SATC’s creative requirements including brochures, events and marketing collateral, branding, signage, newspaper and magazine advertisements, reports and online advertising.

The team manages a panel of contracted photographers who undertake photo shoots creating visual assets in-line with SATC’s marketing brand, which are uploaded to an online media gallery for access by the tourism industry, associated industries and the media.

The Brand team manages SATC’s content marketing initiatives, where the team works with independent filmmakers, writers and photographers to create video, articles and photo blogs for SATC to distribute online in the promotion of South Australia, which includes southaustralia.com, YouTube, social media and an email database of 100,000 domestic consumers.

### Regional Marketing

#### Regional Marketing

This unit communicates with key tourism contacts, regional operators, and the Regional Tourism Offices (RTOs) in each region, to communicate with them SATC marketing activities and the opportunities for involvement in these activities. The regional marketing team assists operators and RTOs in relation to the marketing of their region and ensures regional marketing is in-line with regional brand positioning.

The Regional Marketing team produces key regional collateral (primarily the 12 regional visitor guides, and the Wine & Food Guide), also having input into development of campaigns for intrastate and interstate markets, regional events promotion, coordinating SATC presence at consumer events such as Caravan and Camping shows, the Royal Adelaide Show and the AFTA Sunday Mail Holiday Expo.

#### Visitor Information Centre

The SATC closed the South Australian Visitor Information Centre on June 30, 2014, which was co-located with ServiceSA on North Terrace. From July 1, 2014, SATC has worked in collaboration with the Adelaide City Council to operate the Adelaide Visitor Information Centre located in James Place, off Rundle Mall.

The new Centre is open seven days and is staffed by Adelaide City Council volunteers. The Centre provides free access for consumers to computers and free Wi-Fi for those visitors who wish to research their Adelaide and regional holidays using their own devices.

The SATC will support the Adelaide Visitor Information Centre via regional
training for volunteers, advertising and listings in relevant guides and publications, as well as the provision of SATC regional visitor guides.

SATC assists and supports the Accredited Visitor Information Centre network of which there are 44 across the state. SATC has contracted SATIC to manage the auditing of the accreditation program.
