The 2014-15 Performance Agreement between the Board of the South Australian Tourism Commission and the Minister for Tourism lists seven strategic priorities to work towards the 2020 industry potential base targets.

### PRIORITY 1: DRIVING DEMAND

#### Influence Brand perceptions, awareness, consideration and intention of the interstate target market via marketing campaigns and public relations activities that build brand and encourage visitation through retail distribution partners and via traditional and digital mechanisms.

Tourism is a key driver of the South Australian economy and the SATC has invested to build on the strength of South Australia’s reputation for our world-renowned food and wine, arts and festivals and vibrant Adelaide culture. The perception and awareness of South Australia’s best assets is crucial to continue growing the tourism industry as a whole.

The SATC has undertaken international, domestic and intrastate marketing campaigns to highlight South Australia’s best assets and experiences In the domestic market, activities predominantly focussed on the Barossa and Adelaide. The “Barossa. Be Consumed” campaign positions the Barossa as a leading food and wine destination with Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane targeted in 2014-15. The “Adelaide. Breathe.” Campaign’s primary objective is to create awareness of Adelaide as a tourism destination and increase positive perceptions of Adelaide, with food and wine and arts/festivals as a key strength and contributing to SA’s Vibrant Adelaide initiative. This campaign targeted Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in 2014-15.

In the digital space, activity included the development of a Search Engine Marketing strategy which sees South Australian product being prominent in Google and online search results, thereby increasing the SA reach to consumers looking for a holiday. The SATC also continued the Through Local Eyes YouTube channel, with six new films being created. The YouTube channel sees South Australian filmmakers creating short films which promote the best of South Australia and the 32 films have attracted more than 1.7 million views.

#### Continue intrastate marketing and public relations activities to increase consideration and visitation by South Australians within South Australia’s 11 regions, via traditional and digital mechanisms.

In the intrastate market, the Best Backyard campaign continued with all of the State’s 11 regions now having their own TV commercial or short film showcasing the products and experiences of those regions. In 2014-15, three new TV commercials were produced for the Adelaide Hills, Limestone Coast and Kangaroo Island. All TV commercials aired on TV for two week bursts on TV and the Yorke Peninsula short film ran for three, two week bursts in cinema. Other activity included targeted cinema screenings, radio, outdoor and digital marketing activity.

#### Deliver brand, tactical marketing and public relations activities, in priority international markets and leverage this with partners using traditional and digital mechanisms.

The SATC maintains international representation in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, North America, New Zealand, Singapore, India and China. The overall objective of international marketing is to position South Australia as a compelling part of the Australian holiday and as a destination in its own right.

In 2014-15, the SATC worked with Tourism Australia to leverage international campaigns such as ‘There is Nothing Like Australia’ brand activities, where all states and territories are promoted under the Tourism Australia brand.

Other campaign highlights included:

* Conducting a digital campaign through the Wechat social media platform aimed at increasing the awareness of four of the touring routes in South Australia;Great Southern Drive, Epicurean Way, Seafood Frontier and Explorer’s Way in the China market.
* Conducted a significant consumer campaign with House of Travel (a leading
travel agent) with the theme of ‘Something Different’ in New Zealand. The campaign offered a range of special deals to consumers to encourage
sales growth. Campaign elements included a TV ad, print insertions in popular
newspapers and digital activity.
* Partnered with Trailfinders (a leading travel retailer) to promote a set of
videos filmed with UK personality Kate Humble in South Australia. The videos
were uploaded to YouTube and promoted through a campaign microsite and on social
media channels. The campaign focused on promoting the State’s nature and
wildlife, and food and wine experiences; and
* Partnered with Expedia in a cooperative online campaign in the USA. The
campaign targeted online consumers who have displayed search or booking
behaviour for the Australian gateways through targeting software.

#### Provide targeted, brand aligned, user friendly content and images to help get shared messages out more strongly across our target markets and via multiple digital platforms including mobile, tablet and desktop.

In 2014-15, the SATC continued to develop branded content for distribution across our own, and third party, platforms.


Six new ‘Through Local Eyes’ films were created (‘Dirty Apron’, ‘Kangaroo Island Hyperlapse’, ‘About Food’, ‘Chasing a Feeling’, ‘You Gotta Try…Fleurieu Peninsula’ and ‘Pleasure and Pain’). These were distributed through YouTube, social media and online. These new films have achieved 503,735 views during 2014-15, contributing to over 1.75 million views across all 31 Through Local Eyes films since the films were launched in 2013.

Between December and February, Virgin Australia featured various Through Local Eyes films on their in-flight entertainment.

The SATC formed a new advertising partnership with youth site ‘AWOL’; which saw 12 individual articles created promoting South Australia to a Sydney and Melbourne-based readership. ‘Junkee’ is another website we have partnered with for distribution of articles (also shared through social media platforms). The SATC also supported the production network Stan, followed by a local timeslot on NWS 9, and will be distributed on YouTube in 2015. The SATC’s media gallery also continued to be updated with new images. New photoshoots included Flinders Ranges and Outback, and Adelaide (Central Market, landscapes, laneways and dining). The SATC also worked in partnership with events such as KI Feastival, Barossa Vintage Festival, and the Crush Festival to obtain more photography from these events. There were 15,000 site visits to our media gallery in 2014-15 and over 5000 orders (up 24% from the previous year).

### Priority 2: Working Better Together:

#### Leverage third party brand equity to further distribute South Australia’s key marketing messages to all visitors through a wide range of partners.

The SATC develops and executes co-operative campaigns with key domestic distribution partners such as retail agents, online retail agents, wholesalers and domestic airlines In 2014-15, the SATC ran 22 campaigns with 15 cooperative partners promoting

South Australia to consumers nationally. Major campaigns were undertaken with Flight Centre, Virgin Australia (including Virgin Australia Holidays) and the Wotif Group.

$1.07 million of SATC spend generated $2.49 million of campaign value from our partners, featuring South Australia. This value covers press, online, radio, digital advertising and targeted communications to their clients.

#### Update the Destination Action Plans and actively partner with each region to deliver Tourism 2020 outcomes.

In 2014-15, the SATC continued to work with and market South Australia’s 11 tourism regions.

The SATC worked with regional tourism organisations (RTOs) to prepare and implement Destination Action Plans (DAPs). These action plans identify achievable priorities which will deliver tourism growth in each region. The first round of DAPs covered the period 2012 to 2015. The second three-year plans covering the period 2015 to 2017 were drafted in close consultation with RTOs in 2014-15.

The SATC hosted regular meetings with the chairs of the 11 RTOs and with the Regional Tourism Managers and will continue to do so, to ensure a coordinated approach to the development of tourism in SA’s regions.

### Priority 3: Supporting What We Have

#### Work with partners on maintaining and increasing access to and within South Australia, including through joint marketing initiatives.

The SATC maintained strong working relationships with all the international and domestic airlines directly servicing Adelaide. This included partnering with airlines to undertake joint marketing activities to raise awareness of South Australia as a tourism destination which assists in ensuring the sustainability of the services.
In 2014-15, 32 cruise ship visits to South Australian ports took place, with a total capacity of up to 87 000 passengers and crew. This included 19 ship visits to the Port Adelaide Passenger Terminal, seven visits to Penneshaw (Kangaroo Island) and six visits to Port Lincoln.
The SATC also continued to pursue additional airline services to Adelaide in partnership with Adelaide Airport, via both existing carriers and international airlines which do not currently service Adelaide.

#### Work with Regional Tourism Organisations through the three-year funding agreement,as well industry and other key players to better connect our tourism industry.

In 2014-15, the SATC provided funding to each of the State’s 11 Regional Tourism Organisations to contribute towards the employment of a local contact person responsible for providing a range of services. These include:

* Visitor guide content and PR/ familiarisations support;
* Communicating to industry;
* Providing advice to regional operators and to the SATC; and
* Identifying and implementing projects of agreed strategic significance.

Additionally, with a focus on the International market, the SATC provided assistance to South Australian tourism operators with an international appeal to increase their capabilities. Assistance included the provision of advice, facilitation of industry partnerships and relationship development and engagement with tourism distribution channels.

### Priority 4: Increasing the Recognition of the Value of Tourism

#### Build on the current strong research program and make evidence based information available to increase the understanding of the value and relevance of tourism to our stakeholders.

In 2014-15, the SATC conducted strong evidence-based advocacy across the tourism industry and more broadly within government. Using the Tourism Satellite Accounts and projecting the creation of 10,000 jobs through achieving the \$8.0 billion tourism industry potential by 2020, the SATC demonstrated to stakeholders the important contribution the broader tourism industry can make to the South Australian economy.

In 2014-15, research resources were published to the SATC Corporate Website including the report series ‘The Value of Regional Tourism’ and the International Visitor Survey and National Visitor Survey results. The production of the ‘Regional Satellite Accounts’ which quantify the economic and jobs impact of tourism at a regional level were also predominantly produced in 2014-15 and are due for release in August 2015.

### Priority 5: Using Events to Grow Visitation

#### Manage, secure and sponsor events, in conjunction with partners, to build a balanced calendar of events contributing to Tourism 2020 outcomes.

The SATC continues to own and manage three major events with two held in the 2014/15 financial year, the Santos Tour Down Under and Credit Union Christmas Pageant as well as secured new events and sponsored a range of existing events and festivals such as WOMADelaide and the Australian International 3 Day Event to build a balanced calendar. These events deliver strong economic, promotional and community benefits for South Australia.

#### Focus sponsorships, including those targeted through the Events Bidding Fund, on core strength areas such as arts and culture, food and wine, sport and mass participation, with a particular focus on off-peak periods and utilizing key infrastructure.

The SATC utilised the Events Bidding Fund to secure ten new major events. These included a Liverpool Football Club v Adelaide United match at the redeveloped Adelaide Oval which was held in July 2015, an off-peak period as well as three major swimming championships, including the 2016 Olympic qualifier and Australian Age Swimming Championships, a mass participation event, both of which are to be held at the South Australian Aquatic and Leisure Centre, a world-class facility completed in 2011. The SATC also provided sponsorship to a number of arts and cultural events, including the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Adelaide Festival of Arts, Adelaide Cabaret Festival, Feast and SALA.

#### Develop the capacity building program for major, regional and local/ community events and festivals across the State.

The SATC undertakes workshops with the aim of upskilling the local industry. In 2014-15, the SATC managed a successful Events and Festivals Industry Workshop held on 19 November 2014 in American River, Kangaroo Island. Thirty people registered to attend. Events South Australia continued its role as a leader of the industry by communicating current issues and trends through its newsletter Events South Australia News.

The SATC sponsors a range of events which align with the SATC’s strategic objectives. Through these sponsorship agreements, the event organisers are provided with in-kind support through general advice, networking opportunities, as well as guidance in terms of marketing their event to new audiences.

In addition, the SATC works closely with the Regional Tourism Managers in each region to identify the needs in the region. The upskilling of key event organisers, as well as evaluating gaps and opportunities throughout the overall event calendar in the respective region are key issues that are usually high on the agenda. These areas are covered off in the new Destination Action Plans.

#### Increase awareness and consideration of SA hero events, through collaborative marketing, public relations and partnerships to trigger visitation.

The SATC has worked to leverage and market our hero events in order to trigger additional visitation and help to raise the profile of South Australia as a destination. Marketing and PR activity has included social media campaigns promoting events, targeting high profile media to undertake familiarisations to reach a wider event specific audience and undertaking event specific advertising.

For example, for the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, the SATC produced three YouTube films targeted at the Indian market. These films amassed more than 141,000 views in the three months leading up to the India vs Pakistan game and coverage in India, highlighting the films. The films were also leveraged on the SATC’s, Adelaide Oval’s and Study Adelaide’s facebook pages.

The Santos Tour Down Under uses partnerships to increase the awareness and consideration of the event. The Detours program is an example of a product that the Santos Tour Down Under has developed with Europcar which highlights and encourages visitors to the event to also experience the State’s tourism products to drive further visitor expenditure.

#### Ensure that jointly administered bid funds are used to win those business events that are identified as best utilising newly completed infrastructure and delivering the highest economic return for the tourism industry. This recognises that increased business events activity will boost expenditure by high value visitors.

The SATC continued to partner with the Adelaide Convention Centre and Adelaide Convention Bureau to support the business tourism sector by attracting more conventions to Adelaide. The Convention Bid Fund has helped secure thirteen major conventions due to be held between 2015 and 2020. These conventions combined will bring more than 15,000 delegates to Adelaide and generate $61.2 million in economic benefit for the State. In May 2015, there were an additional fourteen active and proposed bids for events with a total of 16,900 delegates and an estimated economic value of more than $89 million.

### Priority 6: A Supportive Environment for the Tourism Industry

#### Deliver insights and drive advocacy across public and private enterprise to foster growth and investment.

The SATC plays an important role for the tourism industry by identifying where planning, policy and project objectives of other agencies and levels of government which can be utilised or improved for the benefit of tourism.

In 2014-15, the SATC represented the tourism sector in a wide range of government policy initiatives, including the provision of ten year licences for shark cage dive operators, Naracoorte Caves master planning, creation of Mount Lofty Ranges as an international mountain bike destination and project development of the Kangaroo Island multi-day walk experience.

The SATC also continued to provide planning advice to investors and proponents to assist specific tourism developments throughout the State and provided assistance to South Australian tourism operators with an international appeal to increase their capabilities. Assistance included the provision of advice, facilitation of industry partnerships and relationship development and engagement with tourism distribution channels.

### Priority 7: Organisational Effectiveness

#### The SATC will assist with the implementation of the Government’s proposed restructure of the SATC, namely abolishing the Board and bringing motor sport events under SATC management.

In collaboration with The Motor Sport Group (TMSG), the SATC undertook the planning and due diligence processes to identify and undertake the required actions to ensure a smooth transition process. The SATC team has been closely engaged with TMSG to gain a thorough understanding of the team’s functions and specific activities.

Detailed project planning occurred for each area of integration, which details the specific activities to be undertaken and timeframes for completion of this activity. TMSG was transitioned into the SATC on 1 July 2015.

#### Provide systems and support across all aspects of corporate services to maximise the effective and efficient use of SATC resources and ensure public accountability expectations are met.

The SATC has in place policies and procedures which establish essential controls necessary for good financial management, and the efficient use of the SATC’s resources.

A review and update of these policies took place in 2014-15 to ensure they remain effective and in line with all requirements that the SATC adheres to. In addition, the SATC undertakes an annual Financial Management Compliance Framework. This Framework assesses all relevant policies, procedures, systems, internal controls, risk management, statutory and other financial reporting. The 2014-15 Framework identified no items requiring attention.

#### Embed a strong planning and performance monitoring approach that links long term planning and outcomes to the daily work of each individual in the office, covers strategic risk as well as operational risks.

As part of its leadership role to the South Australian tourism industry, the SATC is responsible for the development and implementation of the South Australian Tourism Plan. The previous plan, the South Australian Tourism Plan 2009-2014, expired in 2014. The South Australian Tourism Plan 2020, was developed and published in 2014. It is a whole–of–industry document, which identifies the key objectives for all tourism stakeholders to drive growth in tourism in South Australia. The SATC Corporate Plan 2015-17 was also developed, flowing directly out of the Tourism Plan and relates to the specific activities of the SATC. Operational Planning was based on these plans which identified activities for all units within the SATC and included the consideration and treatment of risks associated with any activity. In addition, the SATC has in place a Risk Management Policy which mandates all staff to undertake risk management in line with the International Standard (ISO31000:2009) to ensure risks are identified and treated.

#### Embed organisational values and drive continual improvement through review processes.

The SATC has embedded the organisational values into a series of both corporate and operational plans, providing a means of accountability and alignment of our actions (both as individuals and as an organisation).

Functionally, the SATC is committed to continue to engage staff and develop SATC culture through regular interaction and implementation of initiatives through the SATC Culture and Values Group, including representation across all business groups.

The role of the Culture and Values Group is to drive and influence the culture of the organisation through staff engagement and understanding of our corporate values and how they are enacted throughout the business in order to foster greater collaboration and ultimately utilise the collective strengths of staff across the business.

Our values are to develop our staff and the state, act with integrity and respect, have courage to make bold decisions that align with our plans, enjoy our work and what we achieve, and support each other and the industry.
