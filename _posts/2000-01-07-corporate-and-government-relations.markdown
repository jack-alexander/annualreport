# Corporate & Government Relations

Through these relationships, the group strives to raise the profile of the industry and ensure decision makers understand the value of the industry and an economic driver and as a creator of jobs for the State.

### Publicity & Public Relations

The Publicity and Public Relations team works with key influencers and stakeholders both domestically and internationally, to drive demand for South Australia as a holiday destination among consumers. The unit is responsible for all internal and external communications for the organization and works with media, influencers, industry and government to enhance the reputation of the organisation and the tourism industry in South Australia and increase visibility of South Australian regions and tourism offerings. The destination PR team generates positive media exposure for South Australia highlighting our tourism regions, key operators and experiences.

The team works closely with domestic and international marketing to amplify tourism messages for South Australia. The team engages with travel, lifestyle, general print, broadcast, electronic and online media to create inspirational editorial content to trigger the aspiration to visit South Australia.

The team generated an estimated ASR value of $85 million in domestic and international coverage (including famil coverage) for South Australia in 2014/15.

The Corporate PR team manages highly regarded communication channels for media, industry and other key stakeholders, ensuring they are well informed of all news impacting the industry. The team also provides briefings and speeches to Government ministers and agencies on tourism matters.

The PR team is also responsible for media and communications activities related to all major events owned and managed by the SATC, including the Santos Tour Down under, the Credit Union Christmas Pageant, Tasting Australia (including the blogger event, Words to Go) and The Cricket World Cup 2015. In addition, the team supports other key sponsored events including World Tennis Challenge, WOMAD and a range of regional events and festivals.

### Familiarisations

The Familiarisations (or Famils) team plays an important role in generating favourable publicity for South Australia through the organisation of media famils. These media famils generate tens of millions of dollars’ worth of publicity in the markets where the articles about South Australian products and experiences appear.

This valuable return comes from a relatively small investment. The purpose of SATC’s trade famils is to enhance the product knowledge and motivation of the retail trade in selling South Australian tourism product and to demonstrate to wholesalers and inbound operators that South Australia has a broad range of saleable product.

### Strategy & Insights

The Strategy and Insights team has a responsibility across the SATC to provide evidence-based recommendations to operational units that will drive strategies to deliver the $8.0 billion tourism potential. The team is also responsible for managing the research function of the SATC, including tracking the State’s tourism performance using existing national research programs and data and also commissioning bespoke market research.

In the last year, the team has led the implementation of the new South Australian Tourism Plan 2020 through the launch of the SATC Corporate Plan

FY15-17 and the development of the SATC Operational Plan 2015-16. Working directly with the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC), the Strategy and Insights team conducted the analysis underpinning tourism’s recognition as the Premier’s Economic Priority 5: “a growing destination of choice for international and domestic travellers”, which was an instrumental step in securing increased funding for the South Australian tourism industry.

### Policy

The Policy team contributes to the success of the SATC by identifying where planning, policy and project objectives of other agencies and levels of government can be utilised or improved for the benefit of tourism.

The team has worked with other agencies to undertake specific projects, such as the development of a world standard multi-day walk on Kangaroo Island and Naracoorte Caves master planning (with the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources), formalising South Australia as a Great Wine Capital (with Primary Industries and Regions SA), leveraging families of students studying in Adelaide (with StudyAdelaide) and improving service excellence in the taxi industry (with the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure).

It also continued to participate in projects under the National Long Term Tourism Strategy (Tourism 2020), including advancing and reporting on investment and regulatory reform needed to make the tourism sector more competitive and collaborating on investment attraction activities with the Federal Government. The unit has also provided input to the preparation by the Federal Government of the Tourism 2020 Strategic Plan (2015–2020). This includes contributing and supporting the Tourism Ministers’ Meeting and the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism. The Policy team is the key SATC contact point for the South Australian Tourism Industry Council and oversaw the negotiation of two year funding agreements between the two organisations for provision of the South Australian Tourism Awards and Visitor

The unit provides advice across the three tiers of Government and prepares SATC submissions and responses in response to consultation requests. For 2014/15, the Policy team represents the SATC on the Nature Based Tourism Reference Group, Marine Park Steering Committee, the Coast Protection Board, the Naracoorte Caves Interagency Reference Group, the Mount Lofty Ranges Mountain Bike Tourism Reference Group, the Reservoir Recreational Fishing Taskforce, the Giant Cuttlefish Working Group, the State Cycling Strategy Reference Group, plus the Investment Attraction Partnership Group with Austrade as part of the Federal Tourism 2020 Strategy. Consistent with the focus of the Destination Development Unit, the Unit continues to play a significant role in providing planning advice to assist specific tourism developments throughout the State.

### Executive Services

The Executive Services team provides support to the Board of the SATC through the preparation and compilation of Board papers, taking minutes at Board meetings, preparing papers for discussion and determination and organising of regional visits.

The team supports the Chief Executive of the SATC by preparing correspondence and communications, undertaking research and projects and facilitating liaison between the Chief Executive and industry, other government agencies and the Minister for Tourism.

The preparation of briefing notes, parliamentary material and Cabinet documents for the Minister for Tourism and Premier is also an important function of the team. The unit is also responsible for completing Freedom of Information applications.
