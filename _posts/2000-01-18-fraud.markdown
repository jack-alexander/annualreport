# Fraud

The South Australian Tourism Commission has in place appropriate fraud prevention, detection, investigation, reporting and data collection procedures and policies, in line with its fraud risk assessment and fraud control plan. These arrangements meet the specific needs of the SATC, and all reasonable measures to minimise the incidence of fraud, as well as to investigate and recover the proceeds of fraud, have been taken. There were no reported fraud incidents during 2014–15.
