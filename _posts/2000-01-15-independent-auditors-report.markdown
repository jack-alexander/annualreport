# Independent Auditor's Report

### To the Chairman of the South Australian Tourism Commission

As required by section 31 (l)(b) of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1987 and section 23(3) the South Australian Tourism Commission Act 1993, I have audited the accompanying financial report of the South Australian Tourism Commission for the financial year ended 30 June 2015.

The financial report comprises:

* a Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30 June 2015
* a Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2015
* a Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended 30 June 2015

### Auditor’s Responsibility

In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the board of directors, as well as the overall presentation of the financial report. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.

### Opinion

In my opinion, the financial report gives a true and fair view of the financial position of the South Australian Tourism Commission as at 30 June 2015, its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Treasurer’s Instructions promulgated under the provisions of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1987 and Australian Accounting Standards.
