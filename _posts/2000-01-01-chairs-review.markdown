# Chair's Review

### The tourism sector is vital to our state and one that has been identified as a key economic priority for our state. This is an exciting time for tourism, with many new opportunities to grow the tourism industry and increase visitors to our state. The government has invested heavily in tourism and a flourishing tourism industry will positively impact the economy and most importantly will create jobs for the State.

Tourism is an important driver for our economy, contributing $5.4 billion to our state. It is also critical for jobs; the sector employs 32,000 South Australians directly and that number rises to 57,000 when including indirect employment through the tourism industry.

The South Australian Tourism Commission recognises the critical role tourism plays in the economic future of South Australia. The SATC Board is determined and focussed on positioning South Australia as a destination of choice for international and domestic travellers, achieving the States full tourism potential and therefore creating jobs.

While the Commission plays a critical role in driving demand, there’s a much broader responsibility. We know tourism dollars do not stop at the airport, or at our internationally acclaimed restaurants and wineries, hotels or at the newly developed Convention Centre. These dollars extend to make an essential contribution to the economic well-being of South Australians – supporting our small businesses, retail, hotels, schools, hospitals, transport network, the arts and other industries across our State.

2014-15 was a critical year for SATC, with significant focus on industry engagement, consultation and planning. The result of this investment in planning was the development of the South Australian Tourism Plan 2020 outlining the priorities and goals for the tourism sector and reaffirming our ambition for an $8 billion tourism industry by 2020. Achieving the $8 billion tourism expenditure potential set out in the plan will generate nearly 10,000 additional direct jobs in the South Australian economy, widely distributed through our regions.

It is a plan for the whole tourism industry, from solo operators right through to major businesses, associations and all levels of Government. It takes the broadest possible scope, recognizing many types of businesses are part of the visitor experience.

In 2014-15, the SATC continued its focus on the ‘Barossa. Be Consumed.’ campaign as part of SATC’s interstate marketing activities, in-line with the State’s Food and Wine strategy. As at year ending June 2015 (compared to year ending June 2014) an additional 318,000 interstate consumers have now considered the Barossa as a travel destination. The “Adelaide. Breathe’ campaign activity was also showcased in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

Phase Four of the intrastate ‘Best Backyard’ campaign showcased the unique products and experiences of the State’s individual regions, to give South Australians compelling reasons to visit the regions. As a call to action the SATC partnered with Stayz to point consumers to stayz.com.au for great accommodation deals around the State.

Self-drive holidays are one of the fastest growing tourism sectors and to promote South Australia’s spectacular road trips, the SATC launched five Touring Routes at the Royal Adelaide Show in 2014 and developed a mobile responsive microsite promoting the touring routes. The five new touring routes highlight the best of our State and will encourage more interstate and overseas visitors to come to South Australia.

There has been a continued focus on building our digital content assets. Five new Through Local Eyes films including Dirty Apron, Kangaroo Island Hyperlapse, About Food, Chasing a Feeling and You Gotta Try Fleurieu were created. These five new films have amassed 475,000 views, contributing to a total of 1.7 million views across all 31 Through Local Eyes films.

The SATC has also been focussed on building partnerships and opportunities for South Australia’s tourism operators with Tourism Australia’s ‘Best of Programs’; including the Ultimate Wineries Experience, Indigenous tourism, Great Walks and Best of Golfing experiences. Cruise ships arrivals to South Australia continue to grow with 32 cruise ship arrivals to South Australia in the 2014/15 season, an increase of five cruise ship visits to South Australian ports from 2013/14. This included 19 cruise ship visits at the Port Adelaide Passenger Terminal, seven on Kangaroo Island and six at Port Lincoln.

The SATC continues to work with airline partners, Tourism Australia and key trade partners internationally to ensure South Australia continues to be a viable destination. We maintain international marketing and PR representation in all our key international markets. We are focussed on maintaining the momentum in our key international markets. In addition, we are increasing our focus on emerging growth markets like China, South East Asia and India. Rising incomes and maturity of the travellers from the Asian region bodes well for our State. The SATC in its role of industry engagement and advocacy represented the tourism sector in a wide range of government policy initiatives, including provision of 10 year licences for shark cage dive operators, the review of South Australia’s planning system and creation of Mount Lofty Ranges as an international mountain bike destination.

The SATC successfully negotiated with Austrade to secure \$4 million in matched Federal investment over four years towards tourism projects through the Tourism Demand Driver Infrastructure (TDDI) program. The SATC also collaborated with the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources on the preparation of a Nature-Based Tourism Action Plan.

Events South Australia (ESA) continues to grow South Australia’s reputation as an ideal destination for World Class events. Building on the strength of South Australia’s events reputation and our world-renowned food and wine industry is crucial to the growth of the tourism industry as a whole. 2014-15 saw events leverage and shine the spotlight on our State on an international platform. These events have also fully utilised the potential of the newly redeveloped Adelaide Convention Centre and Riverbank. In addition to our repertoire of major managed events like the Santos Tour Down Under and The Credit Union Christmas Pageant, ESA supported 12 other major events like, South Australian Living Artists (SALA) Festival, AFL Masters National Carnival, The Suit, Australian Duathlon Championships, 2014 Australian Short Course Swimming Championships, Championships, World Tennis Challenge, ICC Cricket World Cup, Australian ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 had great impact for the State, and generated \$80 million into the state’s economy. International visitors from India to South Australia have reached an all-time high of 17,000 visitors. The economic benefit for the State went well beyond the massive tourism injection and gave South Australia unprecedented visibility globally. The match was viewed by a vast international audience, not only in India and Pakistan, but also into the United Kingdom, USA and around the world.

It has been a remarkable year for tourism and SATC is well poised to help realise the State’s tourism potential. What I have outlined above is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the activities and results achieved by the SATC locally, domestically and internationally in 2014-15.

The SATC board has been focussed on promoting the critical value of the visitor economy and the role of tourism in strengthening the economy. The State Government has recognised tourism as an economic priority for South Australia and the role of the SATC board has never been more critical.

The SATC recognises the key stakeholders in the visitor economy and is committed to working across government and industry to help deliver economic impact which will ultimately benefit the entire State. The 2015-16 State Budget is testament to the confidence the State Government has in the ability of tourism to deliver positive economic impact and jobs for the State. The SATC has received $50 million over two years to invest in promoting Adelaide and South Australia to the world and raising awareness for our and wildlife and a vibrant Adelaide. There is a lot of expectations from the tourism industry and the SATC is leading the charge to ensure that the industry and government working together can deliver against the targets set in the South Australian Tourism Plan 2020.

The SATC Board is committed to South Australia building a profitable and sustainable tourism industry. The SATC Board comprises of individuals with diverse experience and commercial acumen. They are all experts in their respective fields and connected through their passion and commitment to the tourism industry. Their skills and expertise collectively ensure the healthy operation and functioning of the SATC.

We believe that leveraging our collective strengths and working together will help achieve the targets set out in the plan. We have new board members who have joined the Board in 2015-16. The SATC team and the Board is energised, driven and committed to delivering results. I thank the Board for their commitment and look forward to working together in 2015-16.
