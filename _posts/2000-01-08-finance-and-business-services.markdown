### Finance

The Finance Unit plays a vital role in the effective financial management of the SATC by providing timely and accurate budget and financial information and advice, as well as maintaining a high level of financial controls over its domestic and international operations.

Finance provides a range of financial and business services, supporting the SATC business units and ensuring accountability for government resources.

In 2014/15, the Finance Unit developed and implemented a suite of standardized budget management tools, providing efficiencies and transparent budget forecasting across the organisation. The Unit has reviewed its tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions to minimise tax payable across its international markets while maintaining a rigorous taxation compliance regime. The Finance Unit is also in the final stage in the project to deliver a seamless and robust international accounts processing system.
The Finance Unit continues to manage the relationship with Shared Services SA to maximise the level of support and efficiency of services provided to SATC’s employees, suppliers and customers.

### Commercial & Procurement

The Commercial and Procurement Unit is responsible for monitoring and assisting with the procurement of goods and services within the SATC. This includes the development of tender documents, evaluation of submissions and reporting to the Accredited Purchasing Unit as well as liaising with the State Procurement Board. The Unit is also responsible for assisting with drafting, monitoring and compliance of SATC contracts in consultation with SATC employees as well as providing high level advice, evaluation and reporting in relation to SATC’s commercial matters. In addition, the Unit is responsible for the management and facilitation of SATC’s risk management process, insurance and business continuity plans.

In 2014/15, the Commercial and Procurement Unit undertook 23 procurements each valued at more than $22,000; with a total value of over $4.6 million. During this period the SATC entered into 399 agreements including 144 service agreements, 82 sponsorship agreements, 74 cooperative marketing agreements, 43 licence agreements and 56 other agreements.

During 2014/15, the SATC further consolidated its procurement and contract management system and provided a number of demonstrations to other government agencies, a number of who have progressed implementation of a similar system within their own agency.

The Commercial and Procurement Unit also undertook a significant amount of preparatory work in expectation of the abolishment of the South Australian Motor Sport Board and the functions of this authority transferring to the SATC.

### Information Communication Technology

The Information Communication Technology (ICT) Unit ensures the provision of appropriate ICT systems to facilitate the delivery of SATC business. The Unit also manages and provides support for internet and network services for the SATC and is responsible for the technical systems that support all day-to-day office activity within the SATC. To meet the growing demands of innovation and technology, the Unit maintains reliable wireless internet, project management tools and systems, network access and ICT hardware for media centres created for SATC managed events.

The records management function is the responsibility of the ICT Unit and this ensures that the SATC discharges its responsibilities under the State Records Act and involves the tracking and registration of correspondence and the maintenance of a records management system.

In 2014/15, the ICT Unit continued to roll-out electronic records management across the SATC. The gradual adoption has started to reduce compliance and records management risk through better email and document management. The SATC’s Customer Relations Management (CRM) system has had a number of modules added including the Famils Data Management System, Contracts Management, Feedback Register and electronic direct mail (eDM).

The SATC CRM now centralises tourism business contact information and ensures all information is up to date and relevant.
