<img class="feature-image" src="images/111473.jpg" alt="111473">

1. OBJECTIVES OF THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN TOURISM COMMISSION

The purpose of the South Australian Tourism Commission (the Commission) established under the South Australian Tourism Commission Act 1993 is to assist in securing economic and social benefits for the people of South Australia through the promotion of South Australia as a tourism destination and the further development and improvement of the State’s tourism industry. The principal goals of the Commission are to:

* Add value to the efforts of the tourism industry and other government > agencies, by ensuring a coordinated approach to the promotion of South > Australia which results in an increase in visitor numbers to all regions > of the State thereby increasing the value of tourism to the economy and > generating employment for South Australians;
* Attract, develop, own and support major and strategic events that generate > substantial economic and social benefits for South Australia and promote > the image and profile of Adelaide and South Australia;

* Ensure the development of South Australia’s tourism resources in a socially > responsible way with emphasis on the continued maintenance and > preservation of South Australia’s environmental and cultural heritage and > the profitability and effective utilisation of infrastructure; and

* Achieve a strong corporate team and positive corporate culture that uses its > resources in the most effective and efficient manner.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

#### (a) Statement of Compliance

The Commission has prepared these financial statements in compliance with section 23 of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1987. The financial statements are general purpose financial statements. The accounts have been prepared in accordance with relevant Australian Accounting Standards and comply with Treasurer’s Instructions and Accounting Policy Statements promulgated under the provision of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1987. The Commission has applied Australian Accounting Standards that are applicable to not-for-profit entities, as the Commission is a not-for-profit entity. Except for AASB 2015-7 which the Commission has early adopted, Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet effective have not been adopted by the Commission for the reporting period ending 30 June 2015. Refer to note 3.

#### (b) Basis of Preparation

The preparation of the financial statements requires:

* The use of certain accounting estimates and requires management to exercise > its judgement in the process of applying the Commission’s > accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or > where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial > statements are outlined in the applicable notes;

* Accounting policies to be selected and applied in a manner which ensures > that the resulting financial information satisfies the concepts of > relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the > underlying transaction or other events are reported; and

* Compliance with Accounting Policy Statements issued pursuant to section 41 > of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1987.

In the interest of public accountability and transparency the Accounting Policy Statements require the following note disclosures, which have been included in these financial statements:

a) Revenues, expenses, financial assets and liabilities where the counterparty/transaction is with an entity within the SA Government as at the reporting date, classified according to their nature;

b) Expenses incurred as a result of engaging consultants (as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income);

c) Employee targeted voluntary separation package information;

d) Employees whose normal remuneration is equal to or greater than the base executive remuneration level (within $10 000 bandwidths) and the aggregate of the remuneration paid or payable or otherwise made available, directly or indirectly by the Commission to those employees; and

e) Board/committee member and remuneration information, where a board/ committee member is entitled to receive income from membership other than a direct out-of-pocket reimbursement.

The Commission’s Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Changes in Equity have been prepared on an accrual basis and are in accordance with historical cost convention, except for certain assets that were valued in accordance with the valuation policy applicable. The Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared on a cash basis. The financial statements have been prepared on a twelve month period and presented in Australian currency. The accounting policies set out below have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2015 and the comparative information presented.

### c) Reporting Entity

The Commission is a statutory authority of the State of South Australia, established pursuant to the South Australian Tourism Commission Act 1993. The financial statements and accompanying notes include all the controlled activities of the Commission.

The Commission does not control any other entity and has no interests in unconsolidated structured entities. Informing this view, the Commission considered its involvement with Australian Tourism Data Warehouse Limited (ATDW) and determined that it does not control ATDW. In making this assessment, the Commission considered its power over ATDW, its exposure or rights including protective and substantive rights to variable returns from its involvement with ATDW and the ability to use its power to affect return amounts (that is the ability to direct relevant major activities).

The Commission has not entered into any contractual arrangements which involve the sharing of control or significant influence over another entity.

Transactions and balances relating to administered resources are not recognized as Commission income, expenses, assets and liabilities. As administered items are insignificant in relation to the Commission’s overall financial performance and position, they are disclosed separately in note 33. Administered items are accounted for on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as for controlled items.

### d) Financial Arrangements

The Commission’s principal source of funding consists of monies appropriated by Parliament. The Commission is reliant on the continued provision of funding by SA Government. The financial activities of the Commission are primarily conducted through a Special Deposit Account pursuant to section 21 of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1987.

### e) Budgeted Amounts

Budget information refers to the amounts presented to Parliament in the original budgeted financial statements in respect of the reporting period (2014-15 Budget Paper 4). These original budgeted amounts have been presented and classified on a basis that is consistent with line items in the financial statements. However, these amounts have not been adjusted to reflect revised budgets or administrative restructures or machinery of government changes. The budget process is not subject to audit.

### f) Comparative Information

The presentation and classification of items in the financial statements are consistent with prior periods except where specific accounting standards and/or Accounting Policy Statements have required a change. Where presentation or classification of items in the financial statements have been amended, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation or classification in these financial statements unless impracticable. The restated comparative amounts do not replace the original financial statements for the preceding period.

#### g) Rounding

All amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($’000).

### h) Taxation

The Commission is not subject to income tax. The Commission is liable for payroll tax, fringe benefits tax and goods and services tax (GST). Income, expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of GST except:

* When the GST incurred on a purchase of goods or services is not recoverable > from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), in which case the GST is > recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of > an expense item as applicable; and

* Receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included as part of receivables or payables in the Statement of Financial Position.

Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to the ATO is classified as part of operating cash flows.

Unrecognised contractual commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to the ATO. If GST is not payable to, or recoverable from the ATO, the commitments are disclosed on a gross basis.

### i) Events after the Reporting Period

Adjustments are made to amounts recognized in the financial statements, where an event occurs after 30 June and before the date the financial statements are authorized for issue, where those events provide information about conditions that existed at 30 June.

Note disclosure is made about events between 30 June and the date the financial statements are authorised for issue where the events relate to a condition which arose after 30 June and which may have material impact on the results of subsequent years.

### j) Income

Income is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the flow of economic benefits to the Commission will occur and can be reliably measured.

Income has been aggregated according to its nature and has not been offset unless required or permitted by a specific accounting standard, or where offsetting reflects the substance of the transactions or other event.

The following are specific recognition criteria:

#### Contributions received

Contributions are recognised as an asset and income when the Commission obtains control of the contributions or obtains the right to receive the contributions and the income recognition criteria are met (that is, the amount can be reliably measured and the flow of resources is probable).

Generally, the Commission has obtained control or the right to receive for:

* Contributions with unconditional stipulations - this will be when the > agreement becomes enforceable, that is, the earlier of when the receiving > entity has formally been advised that the contribution has been approved; > the agreement/contract is executed; and/or the contribution is received.

* Contributions with conditional stipulations - this will be when the > enforceable stipulations specified in the agreement occur or are > satisfied; that is income would be recognised for contributions received > or receivable under the agreement.

All contributions received by the Commission have been contributions with unconditional stipulations attached and have been recognised as an asset and income upon receipt.

#### Revenues from SA Government

Appropriations for program funding are recognised as revenues when the Commission obtains control over the funding. Control over appropriations is normally obtained upon receipt.

Where money has been appropriated in the form of an equity contribution, the Treasurer has acquired a financial interest in the net assets of the Commission and the contribution is recorded as contributed equity.

##### Participation fees

The Commission earns income from participants in the tourism industry through cooperative marketing schemes, sponsorship of events, subscriptions and training fees.

##### Entry fees, merchandise sales and commission

Income from entry fees and merchandise sales is derived in respect of events owned and managed by the Commission. Commission consists of income earned on online sales made through the Commission’s website (southaustralia.com).

##### Other income

Other income consists of supply commissions, gain on foreign exchange and sundry income.

##### Net gain from the disposal of non-current assets

Income from the disposal of non-current assets is recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer and has been determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. When revalued assets are sold, the revaluation surplus is transferred to retained earnings.

### k) Expenses

Expenses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the flow of economic benefits from the Commission will occur and can be reliably measured.

Expenses have been aggregated according to their nature and have not been offset unless required or permitted by a specific accounting standard, or where offsetting reflects the substance of the transaction or other event. The following are specific recognition criteria:

#### Employee benefits expenses

Employee benefits expenses include all costs related to employment including salaries and wages, non-monetary benefits and leave entitlements. These are recognized when incurred.

#### Superannuation

The amount charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income represents the contributions made by the Commission to the superannuation plan in respect of current services of current Commission staff. The Department of Treasury and Finance centrally recognises the superannuation liability in the whole of government financial statements.

#### Industry assistance

For contributions payable, the contribution will be recognised as a liability and expense when the entity has a present obligation to pay the contribution and the expense recognition criteria are met. All contributions paid by the Commission have been contributions with unconditional stipulations attached.

#### Depreciation

All non-current assets, having limited useful lives, are systematically depreciated over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the consumption of their service potential.

Assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis.

Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for prospectively by changing the time period or method, as appropriate, which is a change in accounting estimate.

The value of fitouts is amortised over the estimated useful life of each fitout, or the unexpired period of the relevant lease, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the following classes of assets as follows:

Class of asset Useful life (years)

|  **Class of Asset** | **Useful Life (years)**
| --- | ---
| General and events plant and equipment | 3-10
| Pageant plant and equipment | 3-32
| Fitouts | 10-11

### l) Current and Non-Current Classification

Assets and liabilities are characterised as either current or non-current in nature. Assets and liabilities that are sold, consumed or realised as part of the normal operating cycle even when they are not expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date have been classified as current assets or current liabilities. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.

Where asset and liability line items combine amounts expected to be realised within twelve months and more than twelve months, the Commission has separately disclosed the amounts expected to be recovered or settled after more than twelve months.

### m) Assets

Assets have been classified according to their nature and have not been offset unless required or permitted by a specific accounting standard, or where offsetting reflects the substance of the transaction or other event.

Where an asset line item combines amounts expected to be recovered within twelve months and more than twelve months, the Commission has separately disclosed the amounts expected to be recovered after more than twelve months.

#### Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position includes cash at bank and on hand and in other short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less that are readily converted to cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above. Cash is measured at nominal value.

#### Receivables

Receivables include amounts receivable from goods and services, GST input tax credits recoverable, prepayments and other accruals.

Receivables arise in the normal course of selling goods and services to other government agencies and to the public. Receivables are generally settled within 30 days after the issue of an invoice or the goods and services have been provided under a contractual arrangement.

Collectability of receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. An allowance for doubtful debts is raised where there is objective evidence that the Commission will not be able to collect the debt. Bad debts are written off when identified.

#### Non-current assets

Acquisition and recognition Non-current assets are initially recorded at cost or at the value of any liabilities assumed, plus any incidental cost involved with the acquisition. Non-current assets are subsequently measured at fair value after allowing for accumulated depreciation.

All non-current tangible assets with a value equal to or in excess of \$10 000 are capitalised. All Pageant Floats, regardless of their value, are recognised as non-current assets in the Statement of Financial Position. Pageant Floats are recorded at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.

#### Revaluation of non-current assets

All non-current tangible assets are valued at fair value and revaluation of non-current assets or group of assets is only performed when its fair value at the time of acquisition is greater than $1 million and estimated useful life is greater than three years.

Every three years, the Commission revalues its fitouts using internal estimates based on indices or recent transactions. A valuation appraisal by a Certified Practising Valuer is performed at least every six years.

If at any time, management considers that the carrying amount of an asset materially differs from its fair value, then the asset will be revalued regardless of when the last valuation took place. Non-current tangible assets that are acquired between revaluations are held at cost until the next valuation, where they are revalued to fair value.

Any revaluation increment is credited to the asset revaluation surplus, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset class previously recognised as an expense, in which case the increase is recognised as income. Any revaluation decrease is recognised as an expense, except to the extent that it offsets a previous revaluation increase for the same asset class, in which case the decrease is debited directly to the asset revaluation surplus to the extent of the credit balance existing in revaluations reserve for that asset class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amounts of the assets and the net amounts are restated to the revalued amounts of the asset. Upon disposal or derecognition, any revaluation surplus relating to that asset is transferred to retained earnings.

#### Impairment

All non-current tangible assets are tested for indication of impairment at each reporting date.

Where there is an indication of impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated. An amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is recorded as an impairment loss. For revalued assets, an impairment loss is offset against the respective asset revaluation surplus.

##### Fair Value measurement

AASB 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, in the principal or most advantageous market, at the measurement date. The Commission classifies fair value measurement using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements, based on the data and assumptions used in the most recent revaluation.

* Level 1 – traded in active markets and is based on unadjusted quoted prices > in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can > access at measurement date.

* Level 2 – not traded in an active market and are derived from inputs (inputs > other than quoted prices included within level 1) that are observable for > the asset, either directly or indirectly.

* Level 3 – not traded in an active market and are derived from > unobservable inputs. The valuation processes and fair value changes are > reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer at each reporting date.

##### Non-financial assets

In determining fair value, the Commission has taken into account the characteristic of the asset, such as the condition and location of the asset and any restrictions on the sale or use of the asset, and the asset’s highest and best use (that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible). The Commission’s current use is the highest and best use of the asset unless other factors suggest an alternative use is feasible. As the Commission has not identified any factors to suggest an alternative use, fair value measurement is based on current use.

The carrying amount of non-financial assets with a fair value at the time of acquisition which was less than $1 million, or an estimated useful life that was less than three years, are deemed to approximate fair value. Refer to notes 18 and 19 for disclosure regarding fair value measurement techniques and inputs used to develop fair value measurements for non-financial assets.

#### Financial assets/liabilities

The Commission does not recognise any financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value.

### n) Liabilities

Liabilities have been classified according to their nature and have not been offset unless required or permitted by a specific accounting standard, or where offsetting reflects the substance of the transaction or other event.

Where a liability line item combines amounts expected to be settled within twelve months and more than twelve months, the Commission has separately disclosed the amounts expected to be settled after more than twelve months.

#### Payables

Payables include creditors, accrued expenses, employment on-costs and Paid Parental Leave scheme payable. Creditors represent the amounts owing for goods and services received prior to the end of the reporting period that are unpaid at the end of the reporting period. Creditors include all unpaid invoices received relating to the normal operations of the Commission.

Accrued expenses represent goods and services provided by other parties during the period that are unpaid at the end of the reporting period and where an invoice had not been received.

The Paid Parental Leave scheme payable represents amounts which the Commission has received from the Commonwealth Government to forward onto eligible employees via the Commission’s standard payroll processes. That is, the Commission is acting as a conduit through which the payment to eligible employees is made on behalf of the Family Assistance Office.

All payables are measured at their nominal amount, are unsecured and are normally settled within 30 days from the date of the invoice or date the invoice is first received.

Employee benefits on-costs include payroll tax, workers compensation levies and superannuation contributions in respect to outstanding liabilities for salary and wages, long service leave, annual leave and skills and experience retention leave.

The Commission makes contributions to several State Government and externally managed superannuation schemes. These contributions are treated as an expense when they occur.

There is no liability for payments to beneficiaries as they have been assumed by the respective superannuation schemes. The only liability outstanding at balance date relates to any contributions due but not yet paid to the South Australian Superannuation Board.

#### Leases

The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement. The Commission has entered into operating leases.

##### Operating leases

Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight–line basis over the lease term. The straight-line basis is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets.

##### Lease incentives

All incentives for the operating lease for office accommodation are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration agreed for the use of the leased accommodation. Incentives received to enter into operating leases are recognised as a liability.

The aggregate benefits of lease incentives received by the Commission in respect of operating leases have been recorded as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term, on a straight line basis.

The lease incentive received is in the form of fitouts, and as such is capitalised as an asset and depreciated over the remaining term of the lease or estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.

#### Employee Benefits

Employee benefits accrue for employees as a result of services provided up to the reporting date that remain unpaid. Long term employee benefits are measured at present value and short-term employee benefits are measured at nominal amounts.

Salaries, wages, annual leave, skills and experience retention leave and sick leave the liability for salaries and wages is measured as the amount unpaid at the reporting date at remuneration rates current at reporting date.

The annual leave liability and the skills and experience retention leave liability are expected to be payable within twelve months and are measured at the undiscounted amount expected to be paid.

No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave.

##### Long service leave

The liability for long service leave is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method.

The estimated liability for long service leave is based on actuarial assumptions over expected future salary and wage levels, experience of employee departures and periods of services. These assumptions are based on employee data over SA government entities. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting periods on government bonds with durations that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

Current long service leave reflects the portion of leave expected to be settled within the next twelve months based on previous experience. All other long service leave is classified as non-current.

#### Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Commission has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

When the Commission expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income net of any reimbursement.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted for the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

The workers compensation provision is an actuarial estimate of the outstanding liability as at 30 June 2015 provided by a consulting actuary engaged by the Office for the Public Sector. The provision is for the estimated cost of ongoing payments to employees as required under current legislation. The Commission is responsible for the payment of workers compensation claims.

### o) Unrecognised Contractual Commitments and Contingent Assets and Liabilities

Commitments include operating, capital and outsourcing arrangements arising from contractual or statutory sources are disclosed at their nominal value.

Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, but are disclosed by way of note and, if quantifiable, are measured at nominal value.

Unrecognised contractual commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to the ATO.

If GST is not payable to, or recoverable from the ATO, the commitments and contingencies are disclosed on a gross basis.

### p) Foreign Currency

Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are converted at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Associated currency gains and losses, where material, are disclosed separately in note 8 and note 13 to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

3. NEW AND REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POLICIES

In accordance with the new AASB 1055 Budgetary Reporting, which became effective for the first time in 2014-15, the Commission has included a comprehensive new note “Budgetary reporting and explanations of major variances” (note 30). This note discloses, in respect of the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Investing Expenditure Summary for controlled amounts:

* The Commission’s original budget as published in Budget Paper 4;

* A comparison of the original budget to actual results; and

* Explanations of major variances.

The new AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 11 Joint Arrangements became effective for the first time in 2014-15.

In accordance with AASB 10 the Commission has reviewed its control assessments (that is, the Commission’s involvement with the entity, protective and substantive rights and the ability to direct major relevant activities) and has concluded that there is no impact.

The Commission does not currently control another entity and does not have any joint arrangements within the scope of AASB 11.

The Commission will continue to review its involvement and arrangements with entities it is connected with to determine the impact of AASB 10 and AASB 11 for future years.

Except for AASB 2015-7 which the Commission has early adopted, Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet effective have not been adopted by the Commission for the period ending 30 June 2015. The Commission has assessed the impact of the new and amended standards and interpretations and considers there will be no impact on the accounting policies or the financial statements of the Commission.

4. ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION

In achieving its objective, the Commission provides a range of services classified into the following activities:

### Activity 1: Tourism Development

Promote and assist tourism development, improve visitor access into and around the state, and advise industry in terms of research, policy and planning.

### Activity 2: Tourism Events

To strategically build and promote the state’s event calendar by developing and attracting new events and managing and growing existing events.

### Activity 3: Tourism Marketing

Develop and implement marketing activities and campaigns to increase the number of international and national visitors to and within South Australia. The disaggregated disclosures schedule presents expenses and income information attributable to each of the activities for the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014. Expenses and income attributed to the Commission as a whole have been allocated to each of the activities on the basis of full time equivalent employees in each of the activities. A disaggregated disclosure of the Commission’s assets and liabilities has not been provided as the information is not reliably available.

Total revenues from SA Government consist of $54,353,000 ($53,458,000) of operational funding and $130,000 ($126,000) for capital purposes. For details on the expenditure associated with the operational and capital funding received refer to notes 5 to 10 and note 18. There was no material variance between the amount appropriated and the expenditure associated with this appropriation. The original amount appropriated to the Commission under the annual Appropriation Act was $50,502,000. An additional $2,833,000 was received from the Treasurer via the Governor’s Appropriation Fund.

| Accrued revenues | - | 1
| Prepayments | 102 | 492
| Total receivables | 1049 | 1311

#### Movement in the Allowance for Doubtful Debts

The allowance for doubtful debts (allowance for impairment loss) is recognised when there is objective evidence (that is, calculated on past experience and current and expected changes in client credit rating) that a receivable is impaired. An allowance for impairment loss would be recognised under “administration and accommodation” in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for specific debtors for which such evidence exists.

#### Interest Rate and Credit Risk

Receivables are raised for all goods and services provided for which payment has not been received. Receivables are normally settled within 30 days. Receivables, prepayments and accrued revenues are non-interest bearing. Other than as recognised in the allowance for doubtful debts, it is not anticipated that counterparties will fail to discharge their obligations. The carrying amount of receivables approximates net fair value due to being receivable on demand. There is no concentration of credit risk. Refer to note 31 for categorisation of financial instruments, maturity analysis of receivables and risk exposure information.

18. Plant and Equipment

| Total fitouts | **956** | 1087
| Total plant and equipment | **1869** | 2059

### Valuation of Fitouts

An independent valuation of the fitout of the Commission’s leased office accommodation was performed in May 2015. The professional valuers engaged to perform the independent valuation were Finn Sievwright, Member American Society of Appraisers and Andrea Carolan BAppSc PRM FAPI Certified Practising Valuer of Maloney Field Services (Australia) Pty Ltd. The valuers used depreciated replacement cost as the best indicator of fair value, considering the need for ongoing provision of government services and assuming the assets are held for continued use. The valuer assessed the current cost of replacing the assets with their modern equivalents less deductions for physical deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimisation.

### Carrying Amount of Plant and Equipment

In accordance with APF III all items of plant and equipment that had a fair value at the time of acquisition which was less than $1 million or an estimated useful life less than three years have not been revalued. The carrying values of these items are deemed to approximate fair value. These assets are classified in level 3 as there have been no subsequent adjustments to their value, except for management assumptions about the assets’ condition and remaining useful life. Plant and equipment includes $410000 ($396000) of fully depreciated plant and equipment still in use.

### Impairment

There were no indications of impairment of plant and equipment at 30 June 2015.

### Reconciliation of Non-Current Assets

19. Fair Value Measurement

**Fair Value Hierarchy**

The fair value of non-financial assets must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes. The Commission categorises non-financial assets measured at fair value into hierarchy based on the level of inputs used in measurement. Fair value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position are categorised into the following levels at 30 June 2015.

The Commission had no valuations categorised into level 1 or level 2.

| --- | **2015** | 2014
| --- | --- | ---
| **Level 3** | **$’000** | $’000
| Recurring fair value measurements | --- |
| General, events and Pageant plant and equipment | **913** | 972
| Fitouts | **956** | 1087
| **Total recurring fair value measurements** | **1869** | 2059

### Valuation Techniques and Inputs

Valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values are at note 18. There were no changes in valuation techniques during 2015.

### Reconciliation of Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The following table is a reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (level 3)

| --- | **2015** | 2014
| --- | --- | ---

| Gains for the period recognised in other comprehensive result | --- | ---
| Revaluation increment | **146** | -
| **Carrying amount at 30 June** | **1869** | 2059

20. Payables

| Payables | **2015** | 2014
| --- | --- | ---
| **Current** | **$’000** | $’000
| Creditors | **1579** | 219
| Accrued Expenses | **963** | 1961
| Employment on-costs | **169** | 176
| Paid Parental Leave scheme payable | **6** | -
| **Total current payables** | **2717** | 2356
| Non-Current: | --- | ---
| Employment on-costs | **120** | 115
| **Total non-current payables** | **120** | 115
| **Total payables** | **2837** | 471

As a result of an actuarial assessment performed by the Department of Treasury and Finance, the average proportion of long service leave taken as leave at a whole of government level decreased from an estimate of 40% (2014) to 37% (2015). In accordance with APF IV, management has determined that the Commission’s experience has been sufficiently different over several years to render the use of this average unreliable. The percentage of long service leave taken as leave is 26.7%. The average factor for the calculation of employer superannuation contribution on-cost has remained at the 2014 rate of 10.3%. These rates are used in the employment on-cost calculation. The net financial effect of the changes in the current financial year is a decrease in employment on-costs of $26 000. The estimated impact on 2016 and 2017 is $27 000 and $28 000 respectively.

### Interest Rate and Credit Risk

Creditors and accruals are raised for amounts billed but unpaid. Sundry creditors are normally settled within 30 days. Employment on-costs are settled when the respective employee benefit that they relate to is discharged. All payables are non-interest bearing. The carrying amount of payables represents fair value due to the amounts being payable on demand.

Refer to note 31 for categorisation of financial instruments, maturity analysis of payables and risk exposure information.

21. Other Liabilities

| Non-Current: | --- | ---
| Lease incentive | **321** | 475
| Total non-current other liabilities | **475** | 475
| Total other liabilities | **475** | 693

Lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased assets revert to the lessor in the event of default.

22. Employee Benefits  

| Employee Benefits | **2015** | 2014
| --- | --- | ---
| **Current:** | **$’000** | $’000
| Annual leave | **598** | 603
| Long service leave | **259** | 289
| Skills and experience retention leave | **31** | 19
| Accrued salaries and wages | **162** | 129
| **Total current employee benefits** | **1050** | 1040
| **Non-Current:** | --- | ---
| Long service leave | **1530** | 1242
| **Total non-current employee benefits** | **1530** | 1242
| **Total employee benefits** | **2580** | 2282

AASB 119 Employee Benefits contains the calculation methodology for long service leave liability. An actuarial assessment performed by the Department of Treasury and Finance has provided the basis for the measurement of long service leave.

AASB 119 requires the use of the yield on long term Commonwealth Government bonds as the discount rate in the measurement of the long service leave liability. The yield on long term Commonwealth Government bonds has decreased from 3.5% (2014) to 3.0% (2015). This decrease in the bond yield, which is used as the rate to discount future long service leave cash flows, results in an increase in the reported long service leave liability.

The net financial effect of the change in the bond rate in the current financial year is an increase in the long service leave liability of $68000, employment on-costs payables of $5000 and employee benefits expense of $73000. The impact in future periods is impracticable to estimate as the long service leave liability is calculated using a number of assumptions, of which a key assumption is the long-term discount rate.

The actuarial assessment performed by the Department of Treasury and Finance left the salary inflation rate at 4.0% for long service leave liability and revised the salary inflation rate down from 4.0% (2014) to 3.0% (2015) for annual leave liability and skills, experience and retention leave liability. The net financial effect resulting from changes in the salary inflation rate in the current financial year is a decrease in the annual leave liability and skills, experience and retention leave liability of $6000, employment on-costs payables of $1000 and employee benefits expense of $7000. The estimated impact in 2016 is $13000, $2000 and $15000 respectively. The estimated impact in 2017 is $20000, $3000 and $23000 respectively.

23. Provisions

31. Financial Instruments / Financial Risk Management

#### (a) Financial Risk Management

Risk management is managed by the Commission’s Finance and Business Services group. Risk management policies are in accordance with the Risk Management Policy Statement issued by the Premier and Treasurer and the principles established in the Australian Standard Risk Management Principles and Guidelines. The Commission is exposed to financial risk – liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk. There have been no changes in risk exposure since the last reporting period.

#### (b) Categorisation of Financial Instruments

Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised with respect to each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

The Commission does not recognise any financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value. The carrying value less impairment provisions of receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values due to their short-term nature. All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2 as all significant inputs are observable.

#### (c) Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises where the Commission is unable to meet its financial obligations as they are due to be settled. The Commission is funded principally from appropriation by the SA Government. The Commission works with the Department of Treasury and Finance to determine the cash flows associated with its Government approved program of work and to ensure funding is provided through SA Government budgetary processes to meet the expected cash flows.

The Commission settles undisputed accounts within 30 days from the date of the invoice or date the invoice is first received. In the event of a dispute, payment is made within 30 days from the date of resolution.

The Commission’s exposure to liquidity risk is insignificant based on past experience and current assessment of risk. The carrying amount of financial liabilities recorded in table 31.1 represents the Commission’s maximum exposure.

The following table discloses the carrying amount of each category of financial instrument held by the Commission including the contractual maturity analysis for financial assets and liabilities, that is, liquidity risk. The Commission has assessed the maturity of its financial assets and financial liabilities as being less than one year.

32. Events after the Reporting Period
